# Community & Sharing

Arcio is designed with community sharing in mind:

- Circuit Export/Import: Circuit Boards can be exported to JSON and imported via a custom workbench (server or local).
- Sharing Codes: Short codes allow quick sharing of community circuits (e.g., "kelpy/FullAdder").
- Guide Book Integration: In-game Arcio Guide Book with quick links from items.
- Discord: Community support and discussion (link in original docs).

Note: Sharing features depend on server and mod distribution setups.
