# Overview

Arcio introduces mana-logic automation to Hytale. Systems are built from Arcanium-crafted components, connected by directional Manathreads that carry binary signals (1/0). The mod focuses on approachable progression, clear visuals, and performance for large builds.

Key concepts:

- Mana is the energy for performing actions; some logic is free, action blocks consume mana.
- Manathreads are directional, visible wires; Arc Relays help organize and split signals.
- Circuit Boards offer compact and nestable circuits for advanced users.
