# Getting Started

Welcome to Arcio — a mana-based automation mod for Hytale. This quickstart shows the minimal steps to build basic circuits.

## Goals

- Learn basic connectivity and power.
- Create a simple lamp that turns on/off with a switch.

## Quickstart

1. Craft a Shard Catalyst and place it as a power source (it emits a baseline signal value of 1).
2. Place an Etherlamp where you want light.
3. Use Manathreads (wires) and the Needle Tool to connect the Shard Catalyst output to the Etherlamp input.
4. Add an Arc Switch or Arc Button in-line to control the lamp.

Notes:

- Shard Catalysts act like rechargeable batteries. Use a Mana Generator or Purifier to recharge or provide continuous power.
- Pure logic gates (Sigil Matrix gates) are free and do not consume mana for signal evaluation.
