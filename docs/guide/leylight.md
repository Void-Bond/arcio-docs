# Leylight (Item Transport & Storage)

Leylight is Arcio's item transport and storage subsystem, themed as flowing light.

Components:

- Arc Funnel: Pulls items from adjacent inventories into Leylight networks.
- Chromatic Emitter: Injects items into Leylight networks or adjacent inventories.
- Leylight Mirror: Redirects Leylight paths.
- Leylight Prism: Splits Leylight to multiple outputs.
- Command Transceiver: Item requester over Leylight networks.
- Focal Array: Consumes Leylight to output items at a target inventory.
- Arc Depot: Scalable buffer/storage for Leylight networks.

Leylight networks are visually represented by colored leylight paths. Leylight components consume mana for item movement when performing work at scale.
